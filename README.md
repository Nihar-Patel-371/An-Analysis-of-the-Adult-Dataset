# An-Analysis-of-the-Adult-Dataset
This project presents a comprehensive exploration of the "Adult Dataset", available on Kaggle, aiming to analyse and understand various socioeconomic factors influencing the annual income of the population. 
    
The dataset encompasses diverse attributes, including demographic information, education levels, occupational details, race, gender, and income status. The research employs statistical and machine learning techniques to unveil patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.

The study begins by simulating and studying descriptive statistics of randomly generated data, and acquiring important insights from it. Data are analysed both in discrete and continuous domains. The study begins by preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values and ensure data quality. After ensuring data usability, several co-relations-finding methods and prediction models are developed and implemented through both mathematical approaches and machine learning methods.

The findings of this study contribute valuable insights into the socioeconomic dynamics of the adult population, providing a basis for informed policy decisions and targeted interventions. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques, this research aims to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data, fostering a deeper understanding of the factors shaping individuals' economic outcomes in the adult demographic.
